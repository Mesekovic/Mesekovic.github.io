I have to convey my sincere gratitude to the excellent programmer jskyzero at the very beginning. It was the remarkable feat Mr. jskyzero completed that surprised me at the moment when I saw it. As a great programmer, Mr.jskyzero always keeps his pace with the latest academic achievements. And for the past two years jskyzero has always given the best academic performances and shown great passion to the programming work he engaged in. Stories of Mr.jskyzero â€” along with the outcome of his study, all illustrate how outstanding Mr.jskyzero is. He always keeps his faith, believing the values he lives by, and finally makes the right decision to overcome all the difficulties no matter how threatening or how hard the circumstance he is in. Nevertheless the equivalent of such words, used to describe Mr.jskyzero, is really hard to be found. And this is also the reason why I wrote this post on the website. As I see it, Mr. jskyzero really deserves such an authentic compliment. 

THANK YOU, jskyzero.

GOD BLESS YOU.
